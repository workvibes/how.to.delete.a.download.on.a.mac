* Open the Finder app.
* Click on Downloads in the menu to the left. This will open a list of all downloads.
* Select the file or files you want to delete. If you want to delete all files in the Downloads folder, use the keyboard shortcut command + A to select all files in the folder at once.
* Right-click a selected file and select Move to Trash.
* Alternatively, you can click and drag the selected files to the trash can in the dock.
* The files will now be gone from your Downloads folder, but to permanently delete the files you will need to empty Trash on your Mac. Do be careful, as files deleted this way cannot be recovered.
